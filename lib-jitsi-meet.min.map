The debounced function comes with a `cancel` method to cancel\r\n * delayed `func` invocations and a `flush` method to immediately invoke them.\r\n * Provide `options` to indicate whether `func` should be invoked on the\r\n * leading and/or trailing edge of the `wait` timeout. The `func` is invoked\r\n * with the last arguments provided to the debounced function. Subsequent\r\n * calls to the debounced function return the result of the last `func`\r\n * invocation.\r\n *\r\n * **Note:** If `leading` and `trailing` options are `true`, `func` is\r\n * invoked on the trailing edge of the timeout only if the debounced function\r\n * is invoked more than once during the `wait` timeout.\r\n *\r\n * If `wait` is `0` and `leading` is `false`, `func` invocation is deferred\r\n * until to the next tick, similar to `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0`.\r\n *\r\n * See [David Corbacho's article](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples/)\r\n * for details over the differences between `_.debounce` and `_.throttle`.\r\n *\r\n * @static\r\n * @memberOf _\r\n * @since 0.1.0\r\n * @category Function\r\n * @param {Function} func The function to debounce.\r\n * @param {number} [wait=0] The number of milliseconds to delay.\r\n * @param {Object} [options={}] The options object.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.leading=false]\r\n *  Specify invoking on the leading edge of the timeout.\r\n * @param {number} [options.maxWait]\r\n *  The maximum time `func` is allowed to be delayed before it's invoked.\r\n * @param {boolean} [options.trailing=true]\r\n *  Specify invoking on the trailing edge of the timeout.\r\n * @returns {Function} Returns the new debounced function.\r\n * @example\r\n *\r\n * // Avoid costly calculations while the window size is in flux.\r\n * jQuery(window).on('resize', _.debounce(calculateLayout, 150));\r\n *\r\n * // Invoke `sendMail` when clicked, debouncing subsequent calls.\r\n * jQuery(element).on('click', _.debounce(sendMail, 300, {\r\n *   'leading': true,\r\n *   'trailing': false\r\n * }));\r\n *\r\n * // Ensure `batchLog` is invoked once after 1 second of debounced calls.\r\n * var debounced = _.debounce(batchLog, 250, { 'maxWait': 1000 });\r\n * var source = new EventSource('/stream');\r\n * jQuery(source).on('message', debounced);\r\n *\r\n * // Cancel the trailing debounced invocation.\r\n * jQuery(window).on('popstate', debounced.cancel);\r\n */\r\nfunction debounce(func, wait, options) {\r\n  var lastArgs,\r\n      lastThis,\r\n      maxWait,\r\n      result,\r\n      timerId,\r\n      lastCallTime,\r\n      lastInvokeTime = 0,\r\n      leading = false,\r\n      maxing = false,\r\n      trailing = true;\r\n\r\n  if (typeof func != 'function') {\r\n    throw new TypeError(FUNC_ERROR_TEXT);\r\n  }\r\n  wait = toNumber(wait) || 0;\r\n  if (isObject(options)) {\r\n    leading = !!options.leading;\r\n    maxing = 'maxWait' in options;\r\n    maxWait = maxing ?
