There are\r\n * time and size limit constraints which determine how often batch entries are\r\n * stored.

The method's argument\r\n * is an array which can contain <tt>string</tt>s and <tt>object</tt>s. If given\r\n * item is an object it means that it's an aggregated message. That is a message\r\n * which is the same as the previous one and it's representation has\r\n * the following format:\r\n * {\r\n *   {string} text: 'the text of some duplicated message'\r\n *   {number} count: 3 // how many times the message appeared in a row\r\n * }\r\n * If a message \"B\" after an aggregated message \"A\" is different, then it breaks\r\n * the sequence of \"A\".
