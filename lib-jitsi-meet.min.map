implements an End-to-End Encrypted communication channel between every two peers\r\n * in the conference. This channel uses libolm to achieve E2EE.\r\n *\r\n * The created channel is then used to exchange the secret key that each participant will use\r\n * to encrypt the actual media (see {@link E2EEContext}).\r\n *\r\n * A simple JSON message based protocol is implemented, which follows a request - response model:\r\n * - session-init: Initiates an olm session establishment procedure. This message will be sent\r\n *                 by the participant who just joined, to everyone else.\r\n * - session-ack: Completes the olm session etablishment. This messsage may contain ancilliary\r\n *                encrypted data, more specifically the sender's current key.\r\n * - key-info: Includes the sender's most up to date key information.\r\n * - key-info-ack: Acknowledges the reception of a key-info request. In addition, it may contain\r\n *                 the sender's key information, if available.\r\n * - error: Indicates a request processing error has occurred.\r\n *\r\n * These requessts and responses are transport independent. Currently they are sent using XMPP\r\n * MUC private messages.\r\n */\r\nexport class OlmAdapter extends Listenable {\r\n    /**\r\n     * Creates an adapter instance for the given conference.\r\n     */\r\n    constructor(conference) {\r\n        super();\r\n\r\n        this._conf = conference;\r\n        this._init = new Deferred();\r\n        this._key = undefined;\r\n        this._keyIndex = -1;\r\n        this._reqs = new Map();\r\n\r\n        if (OlmAdapter.isSupported()) {\r\n            this._bootstrapOlm();\r\n\r\n            this._conf.on(JitsiConferenceEvents.ENDPOINT_MESSAGE_RECEIVED, this._onEndpointMessageReceived.bind(this));\r\n            this._conf.on(JitsiConferenceEvents.CONFERENCE_JOINED, this._onConferenceJoined.bind(this));\r\n            this._conf.on(JitsiConferenceEvents.CONFERENCE_LEFT, this._onConferenceLeft.bind(this));\r\n            this._conf.on(JitsiConferenceEvents.USER_LEFT, this._onParticipantLeft.bind(this));\r\n        } else {\r\n            this._init.reject(new Error('Olm not supported'));\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Indicates if olm is supported on the current platform.\r\n     *\r\n     * @returns {boolean}\r\n     */\r\n    static isSupported() {\r\n        return typeof window.Olm !== 'undefined';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Updates the current participant key and distributes it to all participants in the conference\r\n     * by sending a key-info message.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {Uint8Array|boolean} key - The new key.\r\n     * @returns {number}\r\n     */\r\n    async updateCurrentKey(key) {\r\n        this._key = key;\r\n\r\n        return this._keyIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Updates the current participant key and distributes it to all participants in the conference\r\n     * by sending a key-info message.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {Uint8Array|boolean} key - The new key.\r\n     * @retrns {Promise<Number>}\r\n     */\r\n    async updateKey(key) {\r\n        // Store it locally for new sessions.\r\n        this._key = key;\r\n        this._keyIndex++;\r\n\r\n        // Broadcast it.\r\n        const promises = [];\r\n\r\n        for (const participant of this._conf.getParticipants()) {\r\n            const pId = participant.getId();\r\n            const olmData = this._getParticipantOlmData(participant);\r\n\r\n            // TODO: skip those who don't support E2EE.\r\n\r\n            if (!olmData.session) {\r\n                logger.warn(`Tried to send key to participant ${pId} but we have no session`);\r\n\r\n                // eslint-disable-next-line no-continue\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            const uuid = uuidv4();\r\n            const data = {\r\n                [JITSI_MEET_MUC_TYPE]: OLM_MESSAGE_TYPE,\r\n                olm: {\r\n                    type: OLM_MESSAGE_TYPES.KEY_INFO,\r\n                    data: {\r\n                        ciphertext: this._encryptKeyInfo(olmData.session),\r\n                        uuid\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            };\r\n            const d = new Deferred();\r\n\r\n            d.setRejectTimeout(REQ_TIMEOUT);\r\n            d.catch(() => {\r\n                this._reqs.delete(uuid);\r\n            });\r\n            this._reqs.set(uuid, d);\r\n            promises.push(d);\r\n\r\n            this._sendMessage(data, pId);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        await Promise.allSettled(promises);\r\n\r\n        // TODO: retry failed ones?\r\n\r\n        return this._keyIndex;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Internal helper to bootstrap the olm library.\r\n     *\r\n     * @returns {Promise<void>}\r\n     * @private\r\n     */\r\n    async _bootstrapOlm() {\r\n        logger.debug('Initializing Olm...');\r\n\r\n        try {\r\n            await Olm.init();\r\n\r\n            this._olmAccount = new Olm.Account();\r\n            this._olmAccount.create();\r\n\r\n            const idKeys = JSON.parse(this._olmAccount.identity_keys());\r\n\r\n            this._idKey = idKeys.curve25519;\r\n\r\n            logger.debug('Olm initialized!');\r\n            this._init.resolve();\r\n            this.eventEmitter.emit(OlmAdapterEvents.OLM_ID_KEY_READY, this._idKey);\r\n        } catch (e) {\r\n            logger.error('Failed to initialize Olm', e);\r\n            this._init.reject(e);\r\n        }\r\n\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     * Internal helper for encrypting the current key information for a given participant.\r\n     *\r\n     * @param {Olm.Session} session - Participant's session.\r\n     * @returns {string} - The encrypted text with the key information.\r\n     * @private\r\n     */\r\n    _encryptKeyInfo(session) {\r\n        const keyInfo = {};\r\n\r\n        if (this._key !== undefined) {\r\n            keyInfo.key = this._key ?
